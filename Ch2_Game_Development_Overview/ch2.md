Designing and developing a game—especially an XR game—requires a systematic approach to ensure creativity is balanced with technical execution. In this chapter, we’ll explore the **full lifecycle** of game creation, from the first idea to the final playtest.


The process of creating a computer game can be viewed as a sequence of stages that integrate both artistic and technical efforts. While game design is primarily an artistic endeavor, requiring the designer to pursue grand artistic goals, it also necessitates technical mastery of the chosen medium, which, in this context, is the computer. The procedure outlined here is based on the author's experience and is presented as a suggested approach rather than a rigid, formal methodology. Game design is too complex an activity to be reduced to a strict procedure, and a designer's personality should influence their working habits.

The suggested sequence for designing and programming a computer game is as follows:

**1.  Choose a Goal and a Topic**
   This initial step is vitally important, though sometimes overlooked. It begins with deciding what kind of game to create. The most satisfying games to design often stem from a topic or genre that the designer is deeply interested in. 
    
**2.  Research and Preparation**
   Once the goal and topic are firm, the designer should immerse themselves in the topic. This involves reading everything available on the subject and studying previous related efforts. Understanding the mechanics and environment the game will represent is crucial to providing an "authentic feel". 

**3.  Design Phase**
   This phase is where the concrete form of the game begins to take shape. The primary goal is to create the outlines of three interdependent structures:
   - **I/O Structure**: 
    This is the system for communicating information between the computer and the player. It dictates what is possible within the game. The I/O is composed of output (primarily graphics and sound) and input (keyboard, joystick, paddle, mouse). Graphics and sound should be primarily functional and informative, used to convey critical game information and support the fantasy, not merely to show off graphical abilities. The input structure is the player's "tactile contact" with the game and should be designed to be rewarding, not frustrating.
   - **Game Structure**: 
    This is the internal architecture of causal relationships and rules that define the obstacles and interactions within the game. The designer must identify a key element from the topic environment that is central, representative, manipulable, and understandable, and build the game around it.
   - **Program Structure**: 
   This is the plan for the underlying code organization, including memory allocation, definitions of variables and subroutines, and documentation of program flow. This structure translates the I/O and game structures into a real product.
   
   These three structures must be designed simultaneously and work in concert. Decisions in one area must be checked for their impact on the others. The outcome of this phase is the **Game Design Document (GDD)**.

   **Evaluation of the Design**: 
   Before moving forward, the overall design is evaluated for common flaws. Key questions include whether the design satisfies the initial goals and ensures the desired player experience. The stability of the game structure is checked to prevent situations where game values get out of control. The design is also probed for unanticipated shortcuts that allow players to win with minimal effort. The most crucial decision at this stage is whether to abort the game; if it no longer excites the designer or there are significant doubts, it is better to stop now than later, when more effort has been invested.

**4.  Pre-programming Phase**
   The design is approved in this phase.

**5.  Programming Phase**
   This primarily involves straightforward and tedious implementation work requiring attention to detail. 

**6.  Playtesting Phase**
    Playtesting is ideally used to refine and polish the game design. It can uncover both nonfatal, correctable flaws (insufficiency or excess) and fatal flaws (fundamental incompatibilities). 
    
**7.  Post-mortem**
    After release, the game faces critics, whose reviews may not always be accurate or insightful. The designer should pay attention to thoughtful criticism from reputable sources but otherwise focus on whether they met their own goals. Consistent negative feedback might prompt a reconsideration of artistic values.

This suggested process, while not a rigid formula, provides a framework for navigating the complexities of bringing a computer game concept to life, emphasizing the interconnectedness of design, technology, and the player experience. The experience of developing a game like EXCALIBUR illustrates that the real process can be "jerky and mistake-prone," contrasting with this idealized sequence.


## 2.1 Development Process 
### 2.1.1 Goal and Topic Selection

Every great game begins with a **core goal** and **topic** that define its purpose and direction.

The selection of a goal is a subjective process, requiring the designer to choose something they believe in, something that expresses their aesthetic sense and worldview. Honesty to oneself in goal selection is essential; attempting to satisfy the audience without aligning with one's own taste will likely result in an "anemic game". While marketplace realities might sometimes necessitate designing games that are not direct expressions of the designer's deepest interests, such games may lack the psychological impact of those "coming straight from the heart".

The topic is the means by which the goal is expressed – the environment, conditions, and events that communicate the abstract goal. For example, the goal might be to explore the nature of leadership, and the topic could be the Arthurian legends. It's a significant mistake to prioritize the topic over the goal. The topic must be carefully examined for its ability to successfully realize the game's goals, as some topics carry emotional baggage that could interfere.

#### Goal

* **Entertainment** – Creating fun, immersive experiences.
* **Education** – Teaching concepts interactively.
* **Training** – Simulating real-world scenarios for skill development.
* **Artistic Expression** – Sharing personal or cultural narratives.

#### Topic

* Topics should resonate with the intended audience.
* Consider **cultural relevance**, **market trends**, and **technical feasibility**.

**Example**: For a VR history game, the topic could be “Ancient Civilizations” with a goal of making historical events feel immersive and interactive.



### 2.1.2 Research and Preparation

Research ensures the game is both **inspired and feasible**. During this phase, it's critical not to commit much to paper and, above all, write no code. This is a time for contemplation, meditation, and weaving together the goal, topic, and research findings. Specific implementation ideas will arise but should be considered candidates, not requirements, and must be ruthlessly winnowed later. Impatience in this phase can lead to game-killing mistakes.

#### Market Research

* Study similar games to understand what works.
* Identify gaps in existing offerings.

#### Technical Research

* Determine required hardware (e.g., Oculus Quest, HTC Vive).
* Evaluate software tools (Unity, Unreal Engine, Three.js).

## 2.1.3 Design Phase

The design phase translates ideas into a blueprint. Since GDD is the key outcome of the design phase, we describe the GDD in details in the following sections. 

#### 2.1.3.1 Game Design Document (GDD)

A Game Design Document (GDD) is a software design document that serves as a blueprint from which your game is to be built. It acts as a guiding vision of the game as a whole, bringing together ideas and plans related to the design, development, and business aspects of your game. Essentially, a GDD is a collection of information that you or your team create before the game is developed, outlining its genre, aesthetics, themes, mechanics, and what the player will do.

The primary purpose of a GDD is to explain your game idea to someone. This "someone" can include:
*   **Yourself:** Especially for solo developers, it helps you keep track of project details, remember important information, and ensure your evolving game idea stays coherent and on track. It forces you to think about all areas of the game, even those you might not naturally focus on.
*   **The Development Team:** It ensures everyone is on the same page, acting as a central hub for discovering, discussing, and solving issues collaboratively. Visual aids like diagrams and images help different team members, such as programmers and artists, digest the information more easily.
*   **Investors and Clients:** The GDD, particularly its marketing section, is crucial for pitching the game concept** and demonstrating its commercial viability, target audience, and competitive advantages.
*   **Publishers and Distributors:** It provides necessary information for those who will approve or disapprove the game, making the game's appeal clear.
*   **Players:** In specific contexts, like tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) campaigns, a setting design document (a type of GDD) can be used to pitch a concept directly to players.

It's important to understand that there is no single, static formula for a GDD, and its template can vary significantly between different game development companies and projects. Traditionally, GDDs were lengthy, detailed documents, sometimes exceeding a hundred pages. However, with the evolution of game development processes towards more agile methodologies, the approach to GDDs has changed. Modern GDDs are often lightweight and minimalist, starting as a single-page overview and evolving continually with the project. They are considered **living documents** that must be updated regularly to remain useful. The emphasis is on being clear, concise, and incorporating visual aids such as images, diagrams, and flowcharts to enhance understanding and readability. For larger projects, a GDD might even be broken down into multiple separate documents or organized as an internal wiki.


#### 2.1.3.2 Sections in a GDD

A GDD generally includes sections that cover the design, development, and business aspects of a game. Here are common sections and their typical content found in a GDD:

*   **High Concept / Executive Summary**
    *   This is a brief, core description of the game's idea**, often a one-paragraph "summary of a summary".
    *   It avoids overly technical details and focuses on "what your game is about," often using comparisons to well-known games (e.g., "X is a three-dimensional racing game with power-ups like Mario Kart").
    *   The goal is to provide a quick overview so the reader can anticipate important information. An executive summary may also include the game's genre, target audience, and project scope.

*   **Design Pillars**
    *   These are fundamental goals that guide design decisions** and define the desired player experience or "types of fun" the game aims to provide.
    *   They help keep the project on track and prevent feature creep by identifying what's most important to the game's identity.
    *   They should be broad concepts like exploration, combat, crafting, or abstract emotions** such as teamwork, discovery, or creativity.

*   **Marketing**
    This is a large section detailing the commercial aspects of the game.
    *   **Target Audience:** Defines who will play the game, including demographics (age, gender, nationality) and preferences (genre, themes). It's crucial to define who the game *is* for and who it *is not* for, as this sets the tone (e.g., content restrictions like ESRB rating).

*   **Plot / Narrative**
   For games with a significant story, this section provides insight into the **storyboard, worldbuilding, characters, and lore**.
   It can describe the protagonist's journey, the world's history, and other narrative details. This may also include a basic story outline if narrative is important.
   For worldbuilding, additional sections can include History, Present Day, and Narrative & Perspective** (e.g., first, second, or third person POV).

*   **Game-Specific Subsections**
    *   Depending on the game's genre and unique elements, a GDD may include highly specialized sections to clarify its core and innovations.
    *   Examples include 
         *   **"Pieces"** for puzzle games 
         *   **"Level Design"** for platformers (discussing enemies, terrains, power-ups, stage diagrams)
         *   **"Enemies"** for shooters (detailing stats, attacks, and movement patterns).

*   **Documentation Tools:** Consider using tools that support collaborative writing, version history, and visual collaboration (e.g., internal wikis, Nuclino).



#### 2.1.4 Pre-programming and Programming Phase**
The implementation work happened after the approval designs in pre-programming phases. Developer's effort, rather than talent, is usually the crucial factor in programming a game, implying that technical programming skill is less likely to be the sole cause of failure compared to lack of effort.


#### 2.1.5 Playtesting

Playtesting is essential to ensure fun, balance, and technical stability.

#### Types of Playtesting

* **Alpha Testing** – Internal testing with incomplete features.
* **Beta Testing** – Limited public release for feedback.
* **User Experience Testing** – Observing players to refine usability.

In practice, it often reveals fundamental design or programming problems. Playtesting can uncover both nonfatal, correctable flaws (insufficiency or excess) and fatal flaws (fundamental incompatibilities). Trash a game with a fatal flaw; patching after programming is complete offers only limited gains. If serious but nonfatal problems are found, the designer must analyze the root cause, devise multiple solutions, and choose the one that best meets the game's goals, not just the easiest one. Playtesting involves the designer's own testing during debugging and later testing by other players. It is important not to show playtesters an incomplete game, as this can contaminate their objectivity. Playtesters should ideally be familiar with games and able to analyze and criticize from experience. Market research methods involving large numbers of inexperienced players are viewed skeptically for creating great art, though they may be useful for mass-market games. Playtesters should be given a preliminary manual and allowed to experience the game without coaching. Playtesters' criticisms must be evaluated carefully, and the designer should be prepared to reject suggestions incompatible with goals, unachievable, or requiring disproportionate effort. The final stage involves polishing the game, which is critical but often occurs when the designer is tired of the project. This involves fine-tuning, adding small embellishments, and rigorous testing. The preparation of a game manual is also a vital task, helping to overcome computer limitations, provide static information, support the fantasy, and clarify misunderstandings. The designer should write their own manual first, even if a professional writer is hired, as it provides valuable feedback on the design's cleanliness.


#### Feedback Collection

* Surveys and interviews.
* Heatmaps (tracking player movement in XR).
* Error logs for bug identification.

## 2.2 The Game Development Process in Unity

Developing a video game is a thrilling adventure that combines creative vision with technical expertise. Historically, coding games could feel like a massive uphill battle, but tools like **Unity** have dramatically opened game programming up to many people, making it significantly more approachable for those just starting out. As explored through building various projects, the process in Unity involves bringing together diverse technical components and iterating through different stages to create a complete game. Learning to develop games in Unity provides the advantage of a single, coherent resource to guide you on this journey.

### 2.2.1 Unity: The Central Development Environment

At the heart of this game creation process is the Unity game engine and development environment. Unity is described as a powerful, professional game engine that strikes an excellent balance by remaining affordable and approachable for newcomers. It serves as the primary hub where all the different pieces of a game are assembled.

A core aspect of the Unity workflow is its sophisticated visual editor. This editor is where you lay out the scenes in your game, bringing together art assets and code to build interactive objects. The visual editor is central to assembling the game world. However, Unity also provides flexible scripting capabilities, primarily using C# as the programming language. Custom C# code is vital for controlling objects, defining game mechanics, and making the game interactive. This approach targets individuals who already have programming knowledge but are new to Unity and potentially new to game development in general. While the visual editor is powerful, rigorous programming is required to move from an interesting prototype to a polished, release-ready game.

While the combination of a visual editor and sophisticated coding is effective, it can sometimes create difficulties, such as losing track of which objects have specific components attached in complex scenes. Sharing code among multiple projects can also be awkward; although Unity Package Manager exists, manually copying code might sometimes feel simpler, which is not ideal.

### 2.2.2 Building Blocks of a Game

Learning and building a game in Unity involves tackling various technical areas, each contributing essential building blocks to the final product. Based on the projects covered, some key technical areas include:

*   **Movement and Interaction:** Implementing player or character movement in both 3D (first-person and third-person views) and 2D environments. This involves handling player **input** from devices like the mouse and keyboard. **Raycasting** is a fundamental technique, used for detecting what is hit by an imaginary line projected into the scene, which is crucial for interactions like shooting in 3D or implementing point-and-click controls to determine where a player clicks.
*   **Physics:** Incorporating 2D physics for genres like platformers, understanding how objects behave in a simulated environment. Game physics often requires adjustments from real-world physics to fit game needs. Objects with a **Rigidbody** component can be controlled by applying forces or directly setting their velocity.
*   **Graphics and Visuals:** Working with art assets, which are the individual units of visual information (files like images and 3D models) used in the game. This includes displaying 2D images (sprites), often organized in sprite sheets for animation, and importing and using 3D models. Setting up **lighting** and **shadows** (including real-time shadows and static lightmaps) and applying **textures** (2D images used on 3D models) are also part of the process. Creating visual effects like **particle systems** (for fire, smoke, water, etc.) is another component. **Whiteboxing** (or **grayboxing**) is a common first step for building prototype levels using blank geometry. Materials and particle systems are typically created within Unity, while other art assets are often created externally.
*   **User Interface (UI):** Creating graphical user interfaces (**GUIs** or **HUDs**) that display information or allow player interaction, often overlaid on the main game view. Unity's UI system involves placing elements on a **canvas** and linking them to code. A decoupled messaging system can be a useful way to manage communication between the UI and the game scene. Text displays often utilize systems like TextMeshPro.
*   **Audio:** Integrating **sound effects** and **background music**. Unity supports various audio file formats, allows control over volume, and handles both 2D sounds (for UI, etc.) and 3D sounds (positioned in the scene). A central **AudioManager** can be used to manage audio playback and volume, including fading between music tracks. Audio handling is similar for both 2D and 3D games and is crucial for almost all video games.
*   **Networking:** Connecting the game to the internet, which is increasingly important for modern games. This can involve tasks like downloading data using **HTTP requests**, parsing data formats like **XML** and **JSON**, and sending data to a server. **Coroutines** are often used to handle these asynchronous requests. While HTTP requests are suitable for general communication, Unity also supports multiplayer networking APIs (like MLAPI, Mirror, or Photon) for real-time online games, a more complex topic.
*   **Managing Game State:** Developing code structures, often using **manager classes**, to organize and track complex data and the overall state of the game, such as inventory, player health, or mission progress. This involves managing data globally and decoupling data storage from the objects that display that data on screen. Collections like **List** and **Dictionary** are useful for organizing data like inventory items.

**Content Creation and External Tools**

While Unity is the environment for assembling and programming the game, a significant amount of visual content creation is done using external software. Art assets are fundamental to a game's appearance. Game programmers often collaborate with game artists who specialize in creating these assets using tools like Blender or Maya for 3D modeling, and Photoshop or Aseprite for 2D art and textures. Understanding how Unity works with these assets is important, and sometimes programmers create simple stand-in graphics ("programmer art") to be replaced later. Assets are created externally and then imported into Unity. While Unity can sometimes import native application files, exporting to formats like FBX is often preferred for 3D models.

**Assembling and Integrating Components**

A major part of the game development process is taking all the disparate pieces – the art assets, code for mechanics, UI elements, audio clips, network calls, etc. – and assembling and integrating them into a functional, complete game. This involves combining objects and code, potentially from different sources or previous projects, and ensuring they work together. Using **prefabs** (reusable game objects) is essential for managing complexity. Establishing communication systems, such as using a messaging system for UI and scene interaction, helps keep different components decoupled and easier to manage. Structuring the overall game flow, such as controlling transitions between multiple levels or scenes, is also a key part of this stage. Repurposing assets and code from previous projects, even those in different genres, is a common and efficient practice.

**Finishing and Deployment**

Once the core gameplay is established, the process moves towards polishing and preparing the game for players. This includes implementing final game logic like win/loss conditions and setting up saving and loading the player's progress**. While simple settings can be saved using PlayerPrefs, saving an entire game state usually requires writing local files using C#'s I/O methods (though direct file access is restricted in web builds).

The final technical step is deploying the game to the target platforms. Unity is designed for multiplatform development, allowing developers to build executable applications for a huge variety of platforms, including desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux), web browsers (WebGL), mobile devices (iOS, Android), and even VR/XR platforms. The build process involves adjusting various settings like the game's name and icon. Deploying to mobile platforms often requires using external tools like Xcode for iOS or the Android SDK. Unity also supports platform-dependent compilation, allowing different code to run based on the target platform. Furthermore, Unity can support custom plugins to extend its functionality where needed.
