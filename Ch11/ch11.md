## 11.1 Game Story: Neon Outlaw

You are a skilled mercenary known as the **Neon Outlaw**, navigating a dystopian cyber-city under siege. Armed with a high-tech plasma rifle, your mission is to infiltrate enemy strongholds, eliminate hostile drones and cybernetic enemies, and retrieve valuable data caches. The environment is dynamic â€” neon-lit streets, destructible cover, and fast-paced combat define your experience.

**Core Themes:**

* Intense first-person shooting action
* Tactical movement and cover mechanics
* Variety of enemy AI with shooting and patrol behaviors
* Collection of ammo, health packs, and mission objectives

## 11.3 Vibe Coding Approach: Step-by-Step Prompting

Using vibe coding, we break down the game features and ask an LLM to generate Unity C# scripts in steps:



#### Step 1: Generate FPS Player Controller with Mouse Look and WASD movement

**Prompt:**

> Create a Unity C# script for a first-person player controller. The player should move with WASD keys, look around using mouse movement, and be able to jump and crouch. Include smooth camera rotation.


#### Step 2: Implement shooting mechanics with raycasting and ammo management

**Prompt:**

> Generate a Unity C# script that allows the player to shoot a plasma rifle with left mouse button. Use raycasting to detect hits on enemies. Include ammo count, reloading, and shooting cooldown.


#### Step 3: Design enemy AI that patrols and shoots at the player

**Prompt:**

> Generate a Unity C# script for enemy drones that patrol between waypoints and shoot at the player if within range and line of sight. They should have health and be destroyed when health reaches zero.


#### Step 4: Create pickups: ammo packs and health kits

**Prompt:**

> Generate a Unity C# script for ammo and health pickups. When the player collides with these, increase ammo or health and play a pickup sound.



#### Step 5: Setup mission objectives and timer

**Prompt:**

> Generate a Unity C# script that tracks mission objectives such as collecting data caches, with a countdown timer. Display mission progress in UI.


#### Step 6: Build UI for health, ammo, crosshair, and mission status

**Prompt:**

> Generate Unity UI setup and scripts to display player health, ammo count, a crosshair in the center, and mission timer.



#### Step 7: Create Game Manager to handle game states, player death, and mission success/failure

**Prompt:**

> Generate a Unity Game Manager script that manages player health, mission states, game over conditions, and restarting the level.



## 11.4 Sample Code Examples Generated by Vibe Coding


#### FPS Player Controller (Step 1)
**FPSController.cs**
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

        Vector3 move = transform.right * x + transform.forward * z;
        controller.Move(move * walkSpeed * Time.deltaTime);

        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump") && isGrounded)
        {
            velocity.y = Mathf.Sqrt(jumpForce * -2f * gravity);

#### Extensions to PlayerShooting.cs for Ammo Adding

Add this method inside PlayerShooting.cs:

```csharp
public void AddAmmo(int amount)
{
    currentAmmo = Mathf.Min(currentAmmo + amount, maxAmmo);
    UIManager.Instance.UpdateAmmo(currentAmmo, maxAmmo);
}
```



#### 5. Setting Up the Scene

1. Place the Player prefab with **FPSController**, **PlayerShooting**, and **PlayerHealth** scripts.
2. Create several enemy drones in the scene with patrol waypoints and **EnemyAI**, **EnemyHealth**.
3. Place ammo and health pickups at strategic points.
4. Add data cache objects as mission objectives.
5. Setup UI Canvas with **UIManager** components bound to UI elements.
6. Add a **GameManager** object to manage game state.
7. Configure the NavMesh for enemy navigation.
8. Tune lightings and add neon cyberpunk materials for atmosphere.



#### 6. Running and Testing

* Enter Play Mode to test FPS movement and shooting.
* Verify enemies patrol and attack properly.
* Pick up ammo and health to see UI update.
* Complete mission objectives before timer runs out.
* Use console and Debug.Log for troubleshooting.


#### 7. Expanding the Project

* Add weapon switching.
* Introduce more enemy types with different behaviors.
* Add destructible cover.
* Implement multiplayer networking.
* Polish UI and sound effects.




The included zip file bundles everything together.

- All C# scripts (FPSController, PlayerShooting, EnemyAI, Health and Ammo pickups, UIManager, GameManager, MissionTimer)
- README.txt with setup instructions
- Organized folder structure for easy import to Unity
- You can open this in Unity 2022.3 LTS or later and start running and extending the game right away.




## 11.6 Testing and Debugging the FPS Game

* Test smoothness of player movement and camera rotation in Unity Editor.
* Check shooting mechanics: ensure raycast hits register correctly on enemies.
* Verify enemy AI patrol and chase behavior; watch for bugs or stuck navigation.
* Confirm pickups update player health/ammo correctly.
* Use debug logs or gizmos to visualize patrol paths and raycasts.
* Test mission timer for proper countdown and failure handling.
* Use Unityâ€™s Profiler to monitor performance during combat.



## 11.7 Summary of the Chapter

In this chapter, you learned to build a **cyberpunk FPS game** from scratch by:

* Defining a detailed game story with engaging gameplay themes.
* Creating a comprehensive game design document.
* Using **vibe coding** prompts to generate Unity scripts for core gameplay features.
* Combining those modules into a cohesive Unity FPS prototype.
* Applying best practices for debugging and testing complex systems.

This approach leverages AI-assisted coding to speed up iterative game development in Unity.
