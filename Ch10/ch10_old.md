# 10.1 From Game Story to Game Design Document

---

### 10.1.1 Game Story — The Narrative and Player Experience

The **game story** defines the player’s journey, setting, characters, and goals in narrative form. It creates emotional engagement and guides the design.

**Example Game Story:**

> *"In 'Sky Runner,' players control a young adventurer racing through floating islands in the sky, avoiding obstacles and collecting magical orbs to save their village from darkness."*

---

### 10.1.2 Game Design Document (GDD) — Structured Blueprint

A GDD transforms the story into detailed design elements:

| Section            | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Game Overview      | Genre, platform, player goals, story summary          |
| Gameplay Mechanics | Player controls, obstacles, power-ups, scoring system |
| Level Design       | Environment layout, difficulty progression            |
| Art & Audio        | Visual style, sound effects, music                    |
| UI & HUD           | Score display, health bars, menus                     |
| Technical Specs    | Target engine, languages, multiplayer support         |

**Partial GDD for Sky Runner:**

| Section         | Details                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Genre           | 2D side-scrolling platformer     |
| Platform        | Web (JavaScript / HTML5 Canvas)  |
| Player Controls | Left/Right move, Jump            |
| Obstacles       | Spikes, moving platforms         |
| Collectibles    | Magical orbs that increase score |
| Scoring         | Each orb = 10 points             |
| Goal            | Reach end of level without dying |

# 10.2 From GDD to Vibe Coding Prompts

---

### 10.2.1 Breaking Design into Features

Divide the GDD into manageable coding features:

* Scene setup and player character
* Player movement and physics
* Obstacles and collision detection
* Collectible orbs and scoring
* UI elements (score display, game over screen)

---

### 10.2.2 Writing Clear Vibe Coding Prompts

Each feature becomes a prompt for AI code generation.

**Examples:**

* *"Generate JavaScript code to create a player sprite with left/right movement and jump physics in a 2D platformer."*

* *"Generate code to spawn spikes and detect collision with the player, causing game over."*

* *"Generate code for collectible orbs that increment the player's score when touched."*

* *"Generate code for a score display and game over screen in HTML/CSS/JavaScript."*

# 10.3 Case Study: Building "Sky Runner" Using Vibe Coding

---

### 10.3.1 Step 1: Scene and Player Setup

**Prompt:**

> "Generate JavaScript code using HTML5 Canvas to create a 2D platformer player that can move left, right, and jump with gravity."

**AI Output (excerpt):**

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

canvas.width = 800;
canvas.height = 400;

const player = {
  x: 50,
  y: 300,
  width: 40,
  height: 60,
  velocityY: 0,
  speed: 5,
  jumping: false,
};

const gravity = 0.5;

function update() {
  if (keys['ArrowLeft']) player.x -= player.speed;
  if (keys['ArrowRight']) player.x += player.speed;

  // Jumping logic
  if (player.jumping) {
    player.velocityY += gravity;
    player.y += player.velocityY;

    if (player.y >= 300) { // ground level
      player.y = 300;
      player.jumping = false;
      player.velocityY = 0;
    }
  }
}

function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
  ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);
}

function gameLoop() {
  update();
  draw();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

let keys = {};
window.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
  keys[e.key] = true;
  if (e.key === 'ArrowUp' && !player.jumping) {
    player.jumping = true;
    player.velocityY = -10;
  }
});

window.addEventListener('keyup', e => {
  keys[e.key] = false;
});

gameLoop();
```

---

### 10.3.2 Step 2: Adding Obstacles (Spikes) and Collision

**Prompt:**

> "Generate code to create spike obstacles at fixed positions, draw them, and detect collision with the player to end the game."

**AI Output (excerpt):**

```javascript
const spikes = [
  { x: 200, y: 350, width: 30, height: 50 },
  { x: 400, y: 350, width: 30, height: 50 },
];

function drawSpikes() {
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  spikes.forEach(spike => {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(spike.x, spike.y + spike.height);
    ctx.lineTo(spike.x + spike.width / 2, spike.y);
    ctx.lineTo(spike.x + spike.width, spike.y + spike.height);
    ctx.closePath();
    ctx.fill();
  });
}

function checkCollision() {
  spikes.forEach(spike => {
    if (player.x < spike.x + spike.width &&
        player.x + player.width > spike.x &&
        player.y < spike.y + spike.height &&
        player.y + player.height > spike.y) {
      alert('Game Over!');
      document.location.reload();
    }
  });
}

function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
  ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);
  drawSpikes();
}
```

Add `checkCollision()` call inside `update()`:

```javascript
function update() {
  // existing player movement and gravity logic

  checkCollision();
}
```

---

### 10.3.3 Step 3: Adding Collectible Orbs and Score

**Prompt:**

> "Generate code to spawn collectible orbs at random positions. When player touches orb, increase score and remove orb."

**AI Output:**

```javascript
let score = 0;

const orbs = [
  { x: 300, y: 320, radius: 10 },
  { x: 500, y: 280, radius: 10 },
];

function drawOrbs() {
  ctx.fillStyle = 'yellow';
  orbs.forEach(orb => {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(orb.x, orb.y, orb.radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fill();
  });
}

function checkOrbCollision() {
  for (let i = orbs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const orb = orbs[i];
    const dx = (player.x + player.width / 2) - orb.x;
    const dy = (player.y + player.height / 2) - orb.y;
    const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

    if (distance < orb.radius + Math.min(player.width, player.height) / 2) {
      orbs.splice(i, 1);
      score += 10;
      updateScoreDisplay();
    }
  }
}

function updateScoreDisplay() {
  document.getElementById('score').textContent = `Score: ${score}`;
}
```

Add calls inside main loop:

```javascript
function update() {
  // existing code...
  checkCollision();
  checkOrbCollision();
}

function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  // draw player, spikes...
  drawSpikes();
  drawOrbs();
  // draw player...
}
```

---

### 10.3.4 Step 4: UI for Score Display and Game Over

**Prompt:**

> "Generate simple HTML and CSS for score display on top-left and a hidden game over screen that appears on player death."

**AI Output:**

```html
<style>
  #score {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    left: 10px;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 24px;
    color: white;
  }
  #gameOver {
    position: absolute;
    top: 40%;
    left: 40%;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 48px;
    color: red;
    display: none;
  }
</style>
<div id="score">Score: 0</div>
<div id="gameOver">Game Over!</div>
```

Modify the collision code to show game over:

```javascript
function checkCollision() {
  spikes.forEach(spike => {
    if (player.x < spike.x + spike.width &&
        player.x + player.width > spike.x &&
        player.y < spike.y + spike.height &&
        player.y + player.height > spike.y) {
      document.getElementById('gameOver').style.display = 'block';
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationId);
    }
  });
}
```

Save the `requestAnimationFrame` id:

```javascript
let animationId;
function gameLoop() {
  update();
  draw();
  animationId = requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
gameLoop();
```
