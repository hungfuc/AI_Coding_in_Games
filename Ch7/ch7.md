**Learning Objectives**

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

* Explain what **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are and their role in game development.
* Use **prompt engineering** to instruct an LLM to generate working Unity C# scripts.
* Apply LLMs to accelerate **game prototyping** and **content creation**.
* Debug and refine AI-generated scripts for XR games.
* Design and implement an **AI-assisted mini-project**.



## 7.1 Introduction: The Rise of AI in Game Development

Game development has historically been a manual, code-heavy process. Developers relied on **documentation**, **manual scripting**, and **trial-and-error debugging**. Today, with the integration of **LLMs like GPT**, developers can:

* Describe what they want in plain language.
* Receive complete Unity-ready scripts, explanations, and optimization tips.
* Rapidly iterate game mechanics without deep low-level coding.

In the **XR space**, where interactions are more complex, LLM-assisted development can dramatically reduce prototyping time.

## 7.2 What is Vibe Coding?

"Vibe Coding" is the practice of **conversational programming** — telling an AI “the vibe” you want in your game, rather than painstakingly detailing every line of code.

For example:

> “Make my VR pistol spawn a glowing bullet that moves forward and disappears after 3 seconds.”

LLMs interpret your intent, apply Unity API knowledge, and produce a functional starting script.



**Table 7.1 – Traditional Coding vs Vibe Coding**

| Feature            | Traditional Coding | Vibe Coding with LLM |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Code Writing Speed | Slow to Medium     | Fast                 |
| Debugging          | Manual             | Assisted by AI       |
| Learning Curve     | Steep              | Gradual              |
| Creativity Boost   | Limited by skill   | AI-suggested ideas   |
| XR Prototyping     | Complex            | Simplified           |



## 7.3 How LLMs Understand Game Development

LLMs are trained on massive datasets that include:

* **Unity documentation**
* **C# programming examples**
* **Game design blogs and tutorials**
* **Shader and physics scripting guides**

While they cannot “run” Unity internally, they can:

1. Suggest **syntax-correct code**.
2. Provide **pseudo-code for complex mechanics**.
3. Generate **multiple variations** for creative tasks.



## 7.4 Using LLMs Effectively in Game Development

### 7.4.1 Structuring a Prompt

A good prompt has:

1. **Context** – "I’m making a Unity XR shooting gallery game."
2. **Specific task** – "I want a C# script for the player’s gun."
3. **Constraints** – "Bullet speed = 25, destroys after 3 seconds."
4. **Platform details** – "Using Unity XR Toolkit with Oculus Quest 2."



**Example Prompt**:

```
Write a Unity C# script for Oculus Quest 2 using XR Interaction Toolkit where pulling the right trigger spawns a bullet prefab at the gun's muzzle. The bullet should move at 25 units/second, use Rigidbody for physics, and disappear after 3 seconds.
```



### 7.4.2 Iterative Refinement

Rarely will the first AI output be perfect. Use a loop:

1. Generate initial code.
2. Test in Unity.
3. Tell the AI what’s wrong or what you want to change.



## 7.5 Example: Building a VR Shooting Mechanic with LLM

**Step 1 – Ask AI for Base Script**
Prompt:

```
Unity C# script, XR controller, spawns bullet prefab when trigger pressed, applies forward velocity, destroys after 3 seconds.
```

**AI Output**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit;

public class XRShooter : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject bulletPrefab;
    public Transform firePoint;
    public float bulletSpeed = 25f;
    public float lifeTime = 3f;
    public XRController controller;

    void Update()
    {
        if (controller.inputDevice.TryGetFeatureValue(UnityEngine.XR.CommonUsages.triggerButton, out bool pressed) && pressed)
        {
            Shoot();
        }
    }

    void Shoot()
    {
        GameObject bullet = Instantiate(bulletPrefab, firePoint.position, firePoint.rotation);
        Rigidbody rb = bullet.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        rb.velocity = firePoint.forward * bulletSpeed;
        Destroy(bullet, lifeTime);
    }
}
```



**Figure 7.2 – Unity Scene with VR Gun and Fire Point**
*(Diagram showing VR controller model with firePoint transform at barrel tip.)*



**Step 2 – AI-Assisted Refinement**
Developer feedback:

> “Make the bullet glow with a blue trail.”

AI Update:

```csharp
void Shoot()
{
    GameObject bullet = Instantiate(bulletPrefab, firePoint.position, firePoint.rotation);
    Rigidbody rb = bullet.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    rb.velocity = firePoint.forward * bulletSpeed;
    TrailRenderer trail = bullet.AddComponent<TrailRenderer>();
    trail.time = 0.3f;
    trail.startColor = Color.blue;
    trail.endColor = new Color(0,0,1,0);
    trail.widthMultiplier = 0.05f;
    Destroy(bullet, lifeTime);
}
```


## 7.6 Beyond Code – Content Creation with LLMs

LLMs can:

* Write **NPC dialogue**
* Generate **quest descriptions**
* Suggest **level design ideas**
* Create **procedural item names**



**Example – Pirate NPC Dialogue Generation**
Prompt:

```
Generate 10 pirate-themed shopkeeper lines for a VR treasure hunting game.
```

Output:

1. "Arr, ye look like a fine customer with gold in yer pockets!"
2. "These wares be the finest from the Seven Seas!"



## 7.7 Mini Project – AI-Assisted XR Shooting Gallery

**Goal**: Build a VR shooting range using LLM for all scripts.


**Phase 1 – Scene Setup**

* Create shooting gallery props.
* Place targets with colliders.

**Phase 2 – AI Script Generation**

* Gun shooting script.
* Target hit detection script.

**Phase 3 – AI Content Generation**

* NPC announcer voice lines.
* Scoreboard text variations.

*(Diagram showing player start point, gun, targets, and scoreboard.)*



## 7.8 Best Practices

* **Always Review AI Code** before running.
* Keep **documentation** for AI-generated content.
* Combine AI assistance with **your creative vision**.



## 7.9 Chapter Summary

* LLMs can **accelerate** Unity game development.
* Good prompts = better code.
* AI is a **co-creator**, not a full replacement for developers.
* In XR, AI helps both in **mechanics coding** and **creative content**.
