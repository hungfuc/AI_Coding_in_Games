# **8.1 Networking Foundations in Unity**

---

### 8.1.1 Networking Architectures

In multiplayer XR games, networking allows multiple players to share a virtual environment. Two common architectures are:

* **Client-Server:** One authoritative server manages game state; clients send inputs and receive updates.
* **Peer-to-Peer:** Players communicate directly without a central server; harder to synchronize but reduces server costs.

XR games often favor client-server models for consistent state and cheat prevention.

---

### 8.1.2 Transport Protocols

* **TCP:** Reliable, ordered, higher latency. Use for critical data.
* **UDP:** Unreliable, unordered, low latency. Use for frequent, fast updates like player movement.

Unity’s transport layer abstracts this, and frameworks like Netcode use UDP under the hood for performance.

---

### 8.1.3 Example: Simple TCP Client in Unity

*(Include simple C# TCP client code to connect/send message, explained step-by-step.)*

---

### 8.1.4 Example: Simple UDP Client in Unity

*(Include simple UDP client sending position updates.)*

---

### 8.1.5 Example: Starting Host and Client with Unity Netcode

```csharp
public class NetworkStartup : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void StartHost() => NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
    public void StartClient() => NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient();
}
```

---

# **8.2 Multiplayer XR Player Sync with Unity Netcode**

---

### 8.2.1 Syncing Player Movement and Transforms

* Use `IsOwner` to ensure input affects only local player.
* Attach `NetworkTransform` for automatic position/rotation sync.

---

### 8.2.2 Syncing XR Headset and Controllers

* Sync VR headset and controller transforms with custom scripts using `NetworkVariables`.

---

### 8.2.3 Ownership and Authority Management

* Transfer ownership of objects (e.g., grabbed items) using `NetworkObject.ChangeOwnership`.

---

### 8.2.4 Example: Player Movement Script with Ownership Check

```csharp
public class PlayerMovement : NetworkBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        if (!IsOwner) return;
        // Movement input and translation...
    }
}
```

# **8.3 Vibe Coding: AI-Assisted Multiplayer XR Development**

---

### 8.3.1 What Is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding means describing game features or multiplayer behaviors in natural language prompts to an AI (like ChatGPT), which then generates usable Unity C# code. This accelerates prototyping by offloading boilerplate and complex networking logic to the AI.

---

### 8.3.2 Step-by-Step Prompt Approach to Build Multiplayer XR Games

To efficiently use vibe coding, break down your game into **small, manageable features** and craft clear prompts for each. Then iteratively refine the outputs.

---

### Step 1: Define Your Game Concept

Write a short description of the game and its core multiplayer features.

*Example:*
“Create a two-player VR ping pong game where players use controllers to hit a ball, and all player movements and ball physics are synced.”

---

### Step 2: Generate Basic Networking Setup Code

Prompt example:

> “Generate Unity Netcode C# scripts to start a host and client for a multiplayer XR game.”

---

### Step 3: Generate Player Avatar Sync Code

Prompt example:

> “Generate Unity Netcode code that syncs VR headset and controller transforms for each player.”

---

### Step 4: Generate Ball Physics and Interaction Code

Prompt example:

> “Generate Unity Netcode C# code to create a networked ping pong ball with Rigidbody physics. Include server RPCs for applying forces and syncing velocity.”

---

### Step 5: Generate Ownership Transfer Logic

Prompt example:

> “Generate code that transfers network ownership of the ping pong ball to the player who last hit it.”

---

### Step 6: Generate Scoring and UI Logic

Prompt example:

> “Generate a Unity Netcode score manager script that tracks points for two players and displays scores on screen.”

---

### Step 7: Integrate and Test

* Combine the AI-generated scripts into your Unity project.
* Attach components to prefabs.
* Run multiplayer sessions and debug synchronization.
* Refine prompts or code based on testing results.

---

# **8.4 Complete Example: Creating a Multiplayer XR Ping Pong Game Using Vibe Coding**

---

### 8.4.1 Full Game Specification

* Two-player VR ping pong over Unity Netcode.
* Player avatars sync headset and paddle (controller) positions.
* Ping pong ball has synchronized Rigidbody physics.
* Ball ownership transfers to the player hitting it.
* Score up to 11 points, display scores on UI.
* Game state messages (waiting, playing, game over).

---

### 8.4.2 Full Prompt Series with AI Outputs

---

**Prompt 1:** Networking Setup

> “Generate Unity Netcode C# scripts to start a host and a client for a multiplayer VR game.”

*(AI outputs a simple `NetworkStartup` class.)*

---

**Prompt 2:** Player Avatar Sync

> “Generate code syncing VR headset and controller transforms using NetworkVariables in Unity Netcode.”

*(AI outputs an `XRPlayerSync` script syncing head and hand transforms.)*

---

**Prompt 3:** Networked Ping Pong Ball

> “Generate code for a networked ping pong ball using Rigidbody and ServerRPCs to apply forces and sync velocity.”

*(AI outputs `PingPongBall` script with physics sync and ServerRPCs.)*

---

**Prompt 4:** Ownership Transfer

> “Generate code to transfer network ownership of the ball to the player who hits it.”

*(AI outputs a method calling `NetworkObject.ChangeOwnership` inside the ball script.)*

---

**Prompt 5:** Score Manager and UI

> “Generate a score manager using NetworkVariables for two players with a Unity UI text display.”

*(AI outputs a `ScoreManager` script updating UI with scores.)*

---

### 8.4.3 Integrating and Testing

* Import AI-generated scripts into Unity project.
* Create prefabs: player avatar, paddles, ping pong ball.
* Attach scripts and configure NetworkObjects, NetworkTransforms.
* Test with multiple clients and verify sync, ownership transfer, and scoring.

---

### 8.4.4 Final Notes

* Each prompt yields modular, testable code pieces.
* Refine prompts for bug fixes or feature enhancements.
* Vibe coding accelerates XR multiplayer development but requires developer oversight.
