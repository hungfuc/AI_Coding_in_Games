## 1.1 What is a Game?

A game is an interactive system where players engage in structured play, guided by rules, with the aim of achieving specific goals. While the form and complexity of games can vary greatly, most share three fundamental elements:

1. **Rules** – Boundaries and constraints that shape the player’s actions and define how the game operates.
2. **Goals** – Clear objectives that give players direction and purpose.
3. **Feedback Systems** – Indicators that communicate progress, success, or failure (e.g., points, scoreboards, health bars, sound cues).

## 1.2 Why Do People Play Games?

Games have been part of human culture for thousands of years, from ancient board games like Senet to immersive modern XR experiences. But why do people invest so much time in them?

Common motivations include:

* **Challenge** – Testing one’s skills and abilities.
* **Escapism** – Entering an alternate reality to experience something beyond daily life.
* **Social Interaction** – Connecting with friends, competing, or collaborating.
* **Achievement** – Gaining a sense of accomplishment by completing difficult tasks.
* **Storytelling** – Experiencing narratives that evoke emotion and curiosity.


Regarding the psycology of play, two widely recognized theories help explain what keeps players engaged:

* **Flow Theory (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)**
  Players enter a “flow state” when the challenge level matches their skill level.

  * Too easy → boredom.

  * Too hard → frustration.

* **Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci)**
  Players are motivated when three psychological needs are met:

  * **Autonomy** – The ability to make meaningful choices.
  * **Competence** – Feeling effective and capable.
  * **Relatedness** – Feeling connected to other players or characters.


## 1.3 Taxonomy of Games

The types of games can be classified by various prespectives. The following sections discuss the way to classified the games. 

#### By Platform

Games can be categorized based on the medium in which they are played:

- Board Games: 
  Physical boards and pieces (e.g., Chess, Monopoly).
- Video Games: 
  Console, PC, or mobile-based interactive experiences.
- XR Games: 
  Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) experiences.

#### By Genre

Genres classify games by their dominant gameplay style:

- Action: 
  Emphasizes fast reflexes (e.g., platformers, shooters).
- Puzzle: 
  Focuses on logic and problem-solving.
- Role-Playing Games (RPGs): 
  Center on character progression and storytelling.
- Simulation: 
  Recreates real-world systems or scenarios.
- Shooter: 
  Uses projectile combat from first- or third-person perspectives.


**Table 1.1 – Game Genres and Examples**
| Genre       | Example Game          | Core Mechanics                |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Action      | Super Mario Odyssey   | Jumping, timing, enemies      |
| Puzzle      | Portal                | Physics puzzles, portals      |
| RPG         | Skyrim                 | Exploration, quests, leveling |
| Simulation  | Flight Simulator      | Realistic physics, controls   |
| Shooter     | Half-Life: Alyx (VR)  | Shooting, reloading, cover    |


#### By Interaction Type

- Single-player: 
  One player engages with the game world.
- Multiplayer:  
  Multiple players interact simultaneously.
- Cooperative: 
  Players work together to achieve a shared goal.
- Competitive:
  Players compete against each other.

## 1.4 End-of-Chapter Summary

* All games share **rules, goals, and feedback systems**.
* Players are motivated by factors such as challenge, autonomy, competence, relatedness, and storytelling.
* Games can be classified by platform, genre, and interaction style.
* Understanding game taxonomy helps designers identify where their project fits in the industry landscape.


## Exercises

1. **Written:** Choose a game you enjoy and describe its rules, goals, and feedback system.
2. **Diagram:** Draw a flow channel chart for your chosen game, identifying moments of boredom and frustration.
3. **Classification:** Categorize three different games by platform, genre, and interaction type.
